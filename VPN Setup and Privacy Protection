Created a free account and downloaded the desktop client for my OS.
Installed the application and logged in.
2. Connected to a VPN Server
Connected to the closest available server (Netherlands / Singapore).
Successfully established a secure connection.
3. Verified IP Address
Visited whatismyipaddress.com
Confirmed that the IP address and location were different than my actual one.

âœ… IP masking was successful.
4. Tested Encrypted Traffic
Opened websites with HTTPS
Checked the lock icon and certificate to confirm encryption was active.

With VPN: Speed ~13 Mbps (slight drop, expected)
Disconnected and rechecked: IP reverted to real location.
